This software enables the design of compliant rolling-contact architected materials (CRAMs), which consist of lattices of circular cams that roll along each others contours guided by deformed flexure straps. The sofware consist of three MATLAB files. The master file, CRAMtool.m, contains the design toolâ€™s functions. The file, CRAMtool.fig, contains the content necessary to launch the graphical user interface (GUI). The file, images.mat, contains various images required for the GUI. Be sure these files are placed in the same folder on your computer. Open the CRAMtool.m using MATLAB and run the file to launch the GUI. The GUI provides its own step-by-step instructions
