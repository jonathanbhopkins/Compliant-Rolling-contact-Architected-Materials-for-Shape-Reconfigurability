# Contents of this repository and instructions for launching the software tool
This repository contains the files necessary to run the Supplementary Software 1 design tool discussed in the Nature Communications journal article tiled, "Compliant Rolling-contact Architected Materials for Shape Reconfigurability." Supplementary Software 1 enables the design of compliant rolling-contact architected materials (CRAMs), which consist of shape-reconfigurable lattices of circular cams that roll along each others contours guided by pre-deformed flexure straps. 

The sofware consist of three MATLAB files. The master file, CRAMtool.m, contains the design toolâ€™s functions. The file, CRAMtool.fig, contains the content necessary to launch the graphical user interface (GUI). The file, images.mat, contains various images required for the GUI. Be sure these files are placed in the same folder on your computer. Open the CRAMtool.m using MATLAB and run the file to launch the GUI. The GUI provides its own step-by-step instructions for designing CRAMs.
